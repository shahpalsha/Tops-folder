Module 4 : Oops concepts
========================

*Basic concepts of oops:

Q.2 What is OOP? List OOP concepts.
Ans. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming approach that uses objects and classes
     to organize and manage code efficiently.

list of oops concepts:- 
	1. Class
	2. Object
	3. Encapsulation
	4. Abstraction
	5. Inheritance
	6. Polymorphism
	7. Constructor
	8. Destructor

Q.3  What is the difference between OOP and POP?
	
Ans. Different between them :

1. Oop:
   - Organizes code around objects and classes.
   - Encapsulates data within objects, providing better control and protection.
   - Promotes modularity through classes and objects, making the code more organized and reusable.
   - Supports code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism.
   - Better suited for managing complex applications with its structured approach.

3. Pop:
	- Organizes code around functions and procedures.
	- Data is handled by passing it between functions, making it more exposed.
    - Modularity is achieved through functions, but can be less effective for larger programs.
	- Reuse is limited to function calls and can be less flexible.
	- More suited for simpler, straightforward tasks and can become less manageable as complexity grows.
